***Abstract*** 
 
Small vessel disease (SVD) is frequently comorbid with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and genetic risk for AD has been implicated in brain endothelial cells (BECs) of the vasculature. However, the gene regulatory landscape of neurovascular cell types and its intersection with disease risk remains unexplored. Here, we generated gene regulomes for human BECs, mural cells, and other brain cell types. We found AD heritability to be primarily immune-related, with modest enrichment in BECs, whereas SVD was enriched across the neurovascular unit, including astrocytes. Enhancer-to-gene interactomes implicated amyloid processes in both AD and SVD, though the risk genes were mostly distinct for each disorder. Motifs for putative partners of lineage transcription factors in microglia and BECs were enriched for AD and SVD variants at genes linked to disease pathways. Gene prioritization and enrichment analyses further identified potential repurposable drugs, with medications for hypertension suggested as candidates for both AD and SVD. These findings highlight novel regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic targets within the neurovascular system.
