***Abstract*** 

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is frequently comorbid with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and vascular brain endothelial cells (BECs) are enriched for the expression of genes associated with AD genetic risk. However, the gene regulatory landscapes of neurovascular cells and their intersection with genetic risk for disease remains unexplored. Here we have generated gene regulomes for human BECs, mural cells and other brain cell types to show that AD heritability is primarily immune-related and that it shows modest enrichment in BECs. By contrast, genetic risk for SVD is enriched across cells of the neurovascular unit, including astrocytes. Enhancer-to-gene interactomes implicated disease-distinct putative risk genes associated with amyloid and phospholipid processes in AD and senescence-associated pathways in SVD. Motifs for putative partners of lineage transcription factors in microglia and BECs were enriched for AD and SVD variants at genes linked to disease pathways. Gene prioritization and in silico screening of compounds implicated agonists for the vitamin D receptor and inhibitors for MTOR, HDACs and VEGFR for AD. Our findings highlight novel regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic targets within the neurovascular system.
